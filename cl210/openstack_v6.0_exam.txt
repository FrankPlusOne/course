  * Use SSL for HORIZON
  * Use 172.24.12.254 for NTP server
  * Use Veraster9 for KEYSTONE admin user password
  * You should also configure SWIFT storage


2.Configure an Openstack project
  * Create two Openstack projects. One named myproject and another on named testproj.
  * Information on project users is provided in the following task.
  * Configure quotas for the project myproject. The limits should be 2 cores,4 floating IPs, 10gigabytes,1024 megabytes of ram and 3 instances.


3.Configure OpenStack users.
  * Create Robert,George,William and John
  * Robert and George will be part of project myproject with Robert as the administrator.
  * William and John should be in testproj and William should be the administrator.
  * They all should have the following email scheme "username"@domain12.example.com
  * And their password must be Veraster9


4.Create VM flavor

  * Create a public VM flavor named m1.petite.
  * This flavor should configure a VM with 1024M ram and 0GB root disk.
  * There should be a 0GB secondary data disk.
  * The VM should have 0MB of swap space.
  * The VM should only use 1 CPU.

5.Create a block storage volume

  * Create a block storage volume named storage that is 2Gb in size in the myproject project.


6.Add image

  * An image located at http://host.domain12.example.com/Openstack/web.img should be added to the Glance Image Service. This image should be named web, the format is QCOW2 and the image should be available to everyone.


7.Create security groups

  * Create two security groups in myproject, one anmed ssh will allow access to port 22 form the internet. The other will be named web and will allow port 80 access from the internet.


8.Setting private and public network as below:

  * Use 192.168.112.0/24 for a network named private for myproject. This network should have a subnet named int.
  * Use 172.24.12.0/24 for a network named public. This network public, This network should have a subnet named ext.
  * Both networks are attached to router 210-router so that an instance in this project can access public network. OpenSwitch bridges are already set.

  * Create a Swift container named warehouse which can be used by Robert to store files.
  * Please place a copy of http://host.domain12.example.com/conf.data.tgz into the container. The new object should have the same name as the original.


10.Launch an instance

  * Launch an instance named vimage uses the web image and the m1.petite flavor.
  * This instance should use two security groups, ssh and web.
  * The instance should use the key named webkey.


11.Allocate a floating IP

  * The floating ip 172.24.12.40 should be assigned to the instance previously configured.


12.Attach a block storage volume

  * Attach a block storage volume to vimage, volume named /dev/vdb.

13.Snapshot a block storage volume

  * Create a block storage snapshot named strgsnap that is a snapshot of storage in the project myproject.


14.Setting ssh access

  * Create a key pair named webkey in the project myproject and it should be stored in the file /root/.ssh/myident on rhel.domain12.example.com.
  * The floating ip 172.24.12.40 should be accessible by ssh from other hosts. The keypair used to authenticate the ssh connection should be the keypair created above,named webkey.
